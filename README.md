# Social-Media-Analysis

English:
This repository contains all data, scripts and code which were used in my Bachelor Thesis about "The Relevance of Social Media in B2B Industrial Automation".

This project was done for the University of Trier in cooperation with Arend Prozessautomation GmbH, a German Industrial Automation Service Provider.

## Data Mining with Python
Extracted information and data of Arend's Competitors from the following social netwoks:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Xing

Extraction was done by using the public API's (Facebook & Twitter) as well as done by hand for LinkedIn and Xing due to the current lack of addressable API's by those providers.

## Data Analysis with Python
The included iPython Notebooks contain my entire analysis of all mined SME's.
This data was the foundation of my written Bachelor Thesis.

Tools which were mainly used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

### Additional Usage of R
Some additional visualizations (i.e. Twitter WordCloud) were done in the R Programming Language.
